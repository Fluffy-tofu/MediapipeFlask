This repository presents a *straightforward implementation* of the **MediaPipe** library within a web application utilizing the *Flask* framework. Designed primarily for local execution, the project may require specific hosting considerations for public deployment. To host it publicly, one might need a hosting provider offering a directory with permissions to create and overwrite files. Alternatively, platforms like *Google App Engine* could be leveraged, with the option to upload files to, for instance, an *S3 bucket* on **Amazon Web Services**. Additionally, utilizing temporary files could enhance the application's functionality.
